Applying this manifest will start Ubuntu Linux 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish) - running the OpenSSH server and the **Caddy** web server.

Caddy is configured to serve data off the directory `/var/www/`.

The directory `/var/www/` is mounted from your ScienceData home server. The path to the folder which is mounted is specified below. This path is relative to either your homedir, [`/files/`](/index.php/apps/files), or [`/storage/`](/storage/) on your ScienceData home server. In the former case, it is mounted read-only. Read more on `/storage/` [here](https://sciencedata.dk/sites/developer/ManagingFiles/index#storage).

By providing a public SSH key you can access your container via SSH.

The image is pulled from our Docker registry. Build recipes are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/deic-dk/sciencedata_images).
