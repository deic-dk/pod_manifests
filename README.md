# pod_manifests

A basic collection of pod manifests for the [Kubernetes app](https://github.com/deic-dk/user_pods) on sciencedata.dk.

The associated images are hosted on our Docker registry.

Dockerfile recipes and associated files for building the images are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/deic-dk/sciencedata_images).
